# Intro to Data Science, Fall 2020

You need to make a fork of this repository, find your name in the list below, and replace it with something like:

```md
[**@your username**](the URL to your profile) something about you
```

For example, this is what I did with mine:

> [**@gvegayon**](https://github.com/gvegayon) My first programming language was Visual Basic and before going to business school I wanted to be a musician <img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/893619?s=460&u=723af9d8b02e277a5a91e0c179bbdf4450abec4b&v=4" alt="An old picture of me" width="40px">

Notice the figure of my username (that's optional and fun). This is the code I used of writing that line:

```md
[**@gvegayon**](https://github.com/gvegayon) My first programming language was Visual
Basic and before going to business school I wanted to be a musician
<img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/893619?s=460&u=723af9d8b02e277a5a91e0c179bbdf4450abec4b&v=4" alt="An old picture of me" width="40px">
```
Look for your Github username and add a link to your Github profile and something about
yourself (that you don't mind publicly sharing). Remember to only modify the line with your
username!
